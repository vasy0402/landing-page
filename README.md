This is my first Odin project. I'm scared :))), I'm excited, I love this.
I'll put all my interest into this project, even if it's not going to be as important in my 
future career.
I'll be usign CSS and HTML basic concepts to make this.
Good luck to me, I gotta get on it!

UPDATE!
I finished the project, I had to write something down about it.
It's a good design, I made sure to put all my effort into this. It was pretty hard as there 
are many concepts I don't fully understand just yet. All of it took about 4 days to make,
really got stuck on that introduction part damn. But it's done. 
I'm proud of myself, I'm proud of my work.
I hope I'll get back to this some time later and make great changes to it.
I'm proud of you, future me!!!
